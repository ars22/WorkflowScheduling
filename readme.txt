2. Software requirements: Java version 1.6 or newer
---------------------------------------------------

WorkflowSim has been tested and ran on Sun's Java version 1.8.0 or newer.
If you have non-Sun Java version, such as gcj or J++, they may not be compatible.
You can use Eclipse, NetBeans, or Ant to compile and run WorkflowSim

3. Installation and running the WorkflowSim Toolkit
### Welcome to WorkflowSim Pages.
WorkflowSim is a workflow simulator to support large-scale scheduling, clustering and provisioning studies. It is developed by Weiwei Chen, a Phd student from University of Southern California under the Apache License version 2.0. WorkflowSim is not yet fully completed and we welcome your contribution to this project. 

This page introduces the basic features of WorkflowSim and how to install and run it with Eclipse or NetBeans.

### 1. Use WorkflowSim with GitHub/Eclipse

( It is suggested to use WorkflowSim if you are going to contribute back to this project, otherwise it is not required. )


1.1 Register a GitHub account and fork your own branch

Go to the repository page (https://github.com/WorkflowSim/WorkflowSim-1.0) and click 'Fork' on the top-right corner next to 'Star'. Then you will have your own branch of WorkflowSim and you can maintain your codes under this branch and commit your changes to it. In this example, we use 'chenww05' as an example and you will see a new repo called chenww05/WorkflowSim-1.0. Go to your repo, and copy the path. In this case, it is "https://github.com/chenww05/WorkflowSim-1.0.git". 

1.2 Install EGit


Open your Eclipse, go to 'Help'->'Install New Software', in 'Work with', choose '--All Available Sites', make sure you have EGit listed, otherwise click the item and install it. 

1.3 Check out your source codes

First, create a new java project called 'WorkflowSim' (it doesn't have to be 'WorkflowSim'). Right click your project, choose 'Import'. Click 'Git'->'Projects from Git'. Set the URL to be "https://github.com/chenww05/WorkflowSim-1.0.git". And then you will see a branch called 'master', tick it and continue. And you don't need import projects again so just cancel. 

1.4 Import Source Files and Libraries

Right click the project again and choose 'Properties'. Go to 'Java Build Path'. Link two source directories (your_repo_root/examples, your_repo_root/sources)to the source folders. Add two external JARs (your_repo_root/lib/flanagan.jar and your_repo_root/lib/jdom-2.0.0.jar) to the Libraries.  

1.5 Run an Example

Run an example i.e., org.workflowsim.examples.WorkflowSimBasicExample1.java. Open WorkflowSimBasicExample1.java, replace the 

String daxPath = "/Users/chenweiwei/Work/WorkflowSim-1.0/config/dax/Montage_100.xml";

with your real physical file path. Right click on WorkflowSimBasicExample1.java and choose 'Run File'. You should be able to see some output:

98        SUCCESS        2            0            6.91        263.78            270.69            8
99        SUCCESS        2            0            0.83        270.69            271.52            9

### 2. Use WorkflowSim with GitHub/NetBeans

2.1 Register a GitHub account and fork your own branch

It is the same to 1.1.

2.2 Install Git

Go to 'Teams'->'Available Plugins'. Search for 'Git' and install it. 

2.3 Check out your source codes

First, create a new java project with Existing Sources called 'WorkflowSim' (it doesn't have to be 'WorkflowSim'). Right click this project and choose 'Set as Main Project' for convenience. 
Right click this project again and choose 'Versioning'->'Initialize Git Repository'. You don't need to change the root path, just click 'OK'. 

Right click the project and choose 'Git'->'Remote'->'Pull', set the 'Repository URL' to be 'https://github.com/chenww05/WorkflowSim-1.0.git' and the 'Remote name' to be 'master'. Click 'OK' and you will see a branch called 'master', tick it and continue. 

2.4 Import Source Files and Libraries

After a while the download is down, right click the project again and choose 'Project Properties'. Go to 'Sources', click 'Add Folder' and choose two folders (your_repo_root/examples and your_repo_root/sources). Go to 'Libraries', add all jars  (your_repo_root/lib/*.jar). 

2.5 Run an Example

The same to 1.5. 

### 3. Use WorkflowSim with Eclipse but without GitHub
( If you don't want to contribute back to WorkflowSim with your codes, you can use WorkflowSim without GitHub. )

3.1 Download Source Files. 

Skip 1.1 and 1.2. Different to 1.3, we download source files directly from https://github.com/WorkflowSim/WorkflowSim-1.0/archive/master.zip and unzip it to your_repo_root. 

3.2 Switch to 1.4 and continue with the rest steps (1.5). 

### 4. Use WorkflowSim with NetBeans but without GitHub

4.1 Download Source Files

The same to 3.1. 

4.2 Switch to 2.4 and continue with the rest steps (2.5).
